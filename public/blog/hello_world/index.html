<h2 id="ldquo_hello-there_rdquo">“<em>Hello there!</em>”</h2>
<p>I was originally going to publish something much more <em>big braned</em>
as this blog&rsquo;s inaugural article. But, in wanting to publish before the year&rsquo;s
end (and now having little time to do so), I&rsquo;ve settled on writing a bit about
myself and some things I&rsquo;ve learned in the past 2 years, which should serve as
a good pseudo-introduction to me and this blog.</p>
<h2 id="the-collapse">The Collapse</h2>
<p>Like most people my age, I was expecting to enter <em>a</em> (air quotes) <em>new chapter
of life</em> in 2020—also like most people, I ended up just being stuck
inside. For a good while at the beginning of the year I didn&rsquo;t think much of
it. I was still doing a bit of university work, watching YouTube video&rsquo;s was
still fun, and every now and then I&rsquo;d go ride my bike.</p>
<p>At some point though, riding around your neighbourhood, doing homework and
<em>consooming</em> a daily dose of Pewdiepie gets old. In fact, it gets old pretty
quick.</p>
<h2 id="boredom">Boredom</h2>
<p>Ah yes&hellip;good old boredom, a feeling I hadn&rsquo;t had for quite a while (what with
the last year of school and all). I probably got bored sooner than
most of my friends because, at the time, I was afflicted by an odd tingling
pain in my arms whenever I tried to use them for anything either physically
intensive, or that demanded lot&rsquo;s of repetitive motion on the part of my hands.
This meant: no guitar, no chatting on WhatsApp and most of all&hellip;no video
games. So no, to this day I have not played Among Us, ever.</p>
<p>But it was precisely at this time that things started to get interesting.</p>
<p>Some day in mid-April (maybe), I was so bored of scrolling through YouTube that
I decided I&rsquo;d put my time to good use and learn something, and in trying to
think of something to learn I remembered that my Dad had told me once
“Hey you should learn Python! I bet you&rsquo;d really like it”.
So I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try.</p>
<p>As usual with these things, my Dad was right, and I eventually became (and
currently still am) totally obsessed with programming (shortly after he also
gave me the idea of trying Linux).</p>
<h2 id="nonsense">Nonsense</h2>
<p>The funny thing with Linux, VIM, programming languages and everything I
began encountering, is that <strong>none of it made any sense</strong> (at first).</p>
<p>This is pretty commonsensical, new things usually don&rsquo;t <em>immediately</em> make sense.
But the weird thing I noticed, and only just recently, is: <em>there is no
clear, rational process leading up to the understanding of new information</em>.</p>
<p>I came across this idea reading Paul Feyerabend&rsquo;s <em>Against Method</em> (whom I&rsquo;ll probably
write about in future), and bar a few edge cases, I think it describes my
experience pretty well.</p>
<p>Feyerabend&rsquo;s argument is roughly that learning a new skill, conceptual
framework or language, doesn&rsquo;t happen by carefully following the steps which
explain <em>clearly</em> what is to be learned (except in the mind of a pedagogue or in
(((school))))—new information, if it is to be truly absorbed, cannot be offered
up to someone in pieces for them to logically assemble in to what appears to be
<strong>knowledge</strong>. Instead, through playing, experimenting with and exposing
oneself to something new, there is a steady accumulation of what amounts
to <strong>nonsense</strong>, but, if given enough time, this nonsense becomes so
rich that it suddenly crystallizes—like flipping a switch, what was once
unintelligible can now be understood.</p>
<p>Throughout this year everything I&rsquo;ve learned, <strong>all of it</strong>, was learned by
persisting through nonsense.</p>
<h2 id="at-years-end">At Year&rsquo;s End</h2>
<p>So in the spirit of the new year, I leave you with 2 little rules of thumb:</p>
<ul>
<li>You break out of old (sometimes bad) habits when you&rsquo;re bored.<br>
Boredom is your friend.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t stop when none of what you&rsquo;re learning makes sense (especially if the resources
you have on the subject are terrible, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll discover something new).<br>
Become comfortable with nonsense.</li>
</ul>
<p>I bid you all a (late) Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year!</p>
