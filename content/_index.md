## Welcome

Hi, I'm João. 
This site is meant to be a way for me to
practice some web development, and as an
excuse to write
(hence the [__Blog__](/blog) section). 
If you're interested in my computer skills,
[__Software__](https://github.com/segf00lt) will
take you to my Github, where you can judge them yourself. 
In the future more stuff will probably be added,
perhaps some music :)
