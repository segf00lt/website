Around August I returned to university after about a year of being a
semi-dropout. Here are some thoughts on my experience being back.

Whenever people asked me what I was doing during my dropout
period and whether I intended to go back, my answer would usually prompt them
to try and convince me that I'll &ldquo;meet like minded people and make
friends&rdquo; and that I'd be doing something I really enjoyed. For the most
part the latter has been true (digression: is it just me or does everyone
forget which is latter and which is former?)&#8212;The amount of BS work I've
had to put up with in my course is only about 0.1% of my total hours,
everything else (most of which is math) has been quite entertaining, so I can
safely say that it's much more fun than high-school. The former statement,
however, has been mostly false.

From the very beginning of my semester, I noticed that though a small minority
of my classmates were somewhat interested in what we were doing, even this
minority treated everything as they would school work, reacting to difficulty
as something frightening, always asking &ldquo;Is this gonna be on the
exam?&rdquo;, and generally treating the course as a chore. This _schoolboy_
attitude is indicative of the fact that these people aren't actually there
because they want to be, but instead are there due to some external factor.
I haven't straight up asked anyone yet, but I have a hunch that, when
questioned about it, no one really knows _why_ they're at university.

The cause of this ignorance is manifold: first of all, going to university or
some kind of higher/special education is just what you're &ldquo;supposed to
do&rdquo; after finishing school. This makes the university funnel already
quite large, and quite bad at selecting for people who are passionately
interested in what they're applying for. Secondly, most are too lazy or have
too high a time preference to invest some time into _actually_ exploring the
gamut of possibilities laid before them, before pulling the trigger on any one
path (I used to be in this category). Unfortunately, this behaviour is rewarded
by the schooling environment (and the society at large), making it far more
common than it otherwise would be.

Let's prove that last statement:

- Lemma1: a choice with a certain outcome is preferred to a choice with an
  uncertain outcome.
- Lemma2: something about which one has no knowledge is uncertain.
- Lemma3: the only reasonable way to decide on a something with an uncertain
  outcome is through instinct, courage and the capacity for ownership and
  responsibility over ones decisions.
- Lemma4: the capacities listed in Lemma3 are only developed by getting used to
  making choices with uncertain outcomes.

Suppose Alice is a student finishing high-school. She has already done her
final exams and is in the process of applying to a university (how this
application takes place is irrelevant). However, because most of Alice's time
has been spent in a high-school centered microcosm of reality, she has very
little experience of anything beyond that. As a result she is unsure, at this
&ldquo;pivotal&rdquo; moment in her life, as to what she should do. Should she
continue on the path that every adult she encounters has told her is the right
one and enroll in some prestigious course at a prestigious university? Or
should she take time to wait and explore her options on her own?

Alice being a _rational_ individual, clearly see's that proceeding on the path
given to her is a sure bet, the outcome is _certain_, as she has been given
extensive information (which as far as she is concerned is true) about this
path by teachers, family, friends, etc.

On the other hand, exploring on her own is not something she has been exposed
to. It is not necessary for school and as a result occurs only through personal
initiative, that Alice happens not to have. Therefor, having never done or
otherwise heard anything about it, the outcome of this choice is uncertain.
Additionally, since most if not all of her endeavours have involved adult guidance,
directly through a teacher or indirectly through knowledge in textbooks, she
has never had to independently decide on uncertain things, so by Lemma4 and
Lemma3, she is incapable of making such decisions.

Thus, not only would she not be able to decide to wait and explore her options
if this was her only choice, but, by Lemma1, she will prefer the choice of
going to university now.  
__Qed__.

This somewhat contrived proof helps to at least build a decent framework for
understanding why the behaviour I've described is so prevalent.

It's basically more of what I was talking about in
[The Attitude](https://joaodear.xyz/blog/attitude).
They have the same erosive and decadent quality.

# Why

<!-- TODO develop these ideas more -->

I did a very small poll where I asked a handful of my friends who are in
university (~5 people) the following question: how many people do you know that
are truly invested in their course? The highest answer I got was 3 (which
included me and the answerer), and the others where all 0 (update: I got a
&ldquo;_maybe one_&rdquo; the other night at a party).
Why does it have to be like this? Prior to enrolling in Computer Science I
personally fell for the uni scam and enrolled in Architecture, but while I was
there and wasn't sure what I actually wanted to do I still tried to
_get into it_. I explored the field on my own time and tried to become
interested. When I realized it really wasn't for me, I dropped out.
Maybe the majority of my peers don't have a Dad who pushes them when they
get too slack. Perhaps they never did and as a result never became allergic
to doing things half-arsed. This is a truly sad possibility, but I think
it's the most likely one.

No one cares for what they're doing beyond the classroom, no body will work on
stuff apart what they've been told to, and everyone complains and worries about
the work. _Why_? Why then does everyone think university is so extremely
important? That they'll get somewhere by simply _showing up_ and doing what
they're told. That doing _that_ they're somehow learning. Will they ever realize
it's not enough? Oh well, &ldquo;_Who is John Galt?_&rdquo;

<!-- TODO needs rework
The previous paragraph should lead into this one, maybe some callbacks to The Attitude.
May be an opportunity to talk about stagnation or the absence of adventure.
Mention some more Atlas Shrugged?

Edit this:
The most common external factor that motivates people to go to university, is
money. And depending on where you live, university is probably a good
way to ensure you make money. The problem is that the kind of money most people
intend to make is the stable income kind of money, not the bombastic
_let's change the world and get rich_
kind of money. The second kind requires taking risks and assuming responsibility,
something that we've established is rare in the university-going population.
Apart from that, fervent competition and beating others at things is frowned upon.
After all, it's _anti-social_ to strive to be the best, to surpass everyone.

Taken together, the lack of true interest, the discouragement of competition
and the pursuit of economic safety and stability among students will not create
an environment of innovation and excellence, but one of stifling mediocrity.

The environment is not one of innovation and excellence, but one of stifling
mediocrity

# To acquire skill

Reading this you may wonder why _I_ am at university. Unlike my
colleagues I have a very clear and singular purpose: _to acquire skill_.  
Not to engage in university life or student politics, and certainly not
to start an academic career. Simply to become exceptional at difficult things
that I enjoy doing.
This has been my explicit goal since around when I started this blog. I am only at
university in so far as I think university serves this goal. As soon as that
changes, I'm out. As far as I've seen, math education isn't in such a bad
state. But my brush with the course's introductory programming class makes me
skeptical of the other CS focused classes. (Though my CS course's high drop-out
rate may be a sign that my skepticism is misplaced). Most of the first and
second semester classes could be scrapped and replaced with something between
[nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) and
[fromthetransistor](https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor). Subsequent
semesters could focus on studying various branches of CS more deeply, in a
similar first-principles style. I'm thinking _From Matmul to MNIST_ or _From
the Pixel to the Game Engine_. Take a simple version of each branch's stack,
and build the whole thing from scratch.
But I doubt that an approach like this could be done when, in order to
serve the lowest common denominator, you teach your freshmen to program in
python (and spend 3 months explaining basic control flow).

Overall it seems that the diagnosis I've heard others give is correct. The
university is dead, for Computer Science education anyway, It just doesn't know
it. By learning programming on my own I've already outpaced the non-math part
of the curriculum. As soon as I get better at languages like
[coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) and [metamath](https://us.metamath.org/) I'll
likely be able to outpace that too. I think if these languages had more online
material and a greater web presence (coq especially), formal math education
would become just like programming. After that we could take biology, physics,
chemistry, architecture, history, mechanical and electrical engineering,
linguistics&#8212;every field worth taking. If we can build tools for
formalizing the fundamental axioms of these fields, doing better simulation,
better search tools and information repositories etc., intellectual training
starts to look more like just a compiler and stackoverflow. As with all the
best technology, it could make people independent.

I think this is the only way for intellectual training to approach the meritocratic
rigor of martial arts. I don't really trust the judgement of _alt-universities_
(lookin' at you PragerU) in properly selecting candidates, and I imagine you'd
eventually see most of the same behaviour appear in them also. And even if they
did, public opinion would be strongly against such an exclusive institution.
Universities, as they exist now, are architecturally constrained. They can only
take so many people before they become mediocre, and without an outwardly
elitist, skill-based aristocracy funding them they have no choice but to be
democratic. Both for revenue (in those that aren't public anyway) and to keep
the funding from governments and the broader democratic aristocracy coming in.

I've had trouble sleeping for a while. Busy mind, lot's of unexpressed
thoughts. Last night I went out with a good friend who I haven't seen in a
while, and managed to free some of the ideas from my own head. Bronze Age
Mindset talks about the power of great friendships. I guess it's what the
people who told me I'd meet other's like me in university meant. I'll always
keep looking for the others. Whatever replaces university definitely needs to
foster these kinds of relationships. Once again, martial arts set a good
example to be met.
