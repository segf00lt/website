Ever seen that [PBS Space Time video](https://youtu.be/watch?v=4H55wybU3rI)
about Von Neumann Probes? It's a cool video&#8212;The idea of self replicating
robots colonizing the galaxy is cool, but the coolest thing in the video
is a passing reference to a proposal by
[Edward F. Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_F._Moore):

> &#8230;desert or ocean-dwelling self-replicators who's only purpose was to build
> copies of themselves, which humans would then harvest for parts&#8230;

I was reminded of this idea recently reading
[this blog post](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2021/04/25/a-machine-ecology.html).
George talks about machines that can fight entropy, _like life_. Technology that
if left alone &ldquo;&#8230;after 5 years it has built a paradise.&rdquo;
Robots building stuff (themselves included) and thriving without the need for
human aid is a beautiful thing, so let's develop the life analogy further.

### Enter the Mekhosphere

The Earth's Biosphere is an amazingly complex system, particularly in the
relationships between it's inhabitants. Through their interactions the
creatures of the biosphere co-evolve, and it is this co-evolution (in part)
that makes the system _complex_. The biosphere's machine equivalent is the
_Mekhosphere_.

Moore's artificial plants and other self-replicating machines would
facilitate the refinement of natural resources and their transformation into
higher level components, but they don't do much else. A Von Neumann probe is slightly more
interesting, being able to construct planetary infrastructure, but it's still executing
a very simple program. What we want is **life**, and in order to approach that goal we'll
need machines that interact, not just in the cute and cuddly positive-symbiosis way, but
also in predator-prey relationship's. Think _Horizon Zero Dawn_ done on purpose.

In addition to our drone like artificial plants, we stack other classes of
machine on top, forming a _mekhological pyramid_, with everything from peaceful
herbivore to hyper-aggressive apex predator.

When you ascend the ecological pyramid, despite lot's of energy being lost, the
energy density in a given creature increases along with it's biological
complexity (maybe nourishment is a more accurate term than energy)&#8212;1kg of elk
meat is much more filling than 1kg of broccoli because there's a lot more stuff
going on inside the elk's body than in the broccoli (no offense
photosynthesis), also the elk is bigger and has to move. Analogously, ascent in
the mekhological pyramid means an increase in refinement of material and
complexity of components. Plant-like replicators can be quite simple and don't
need the ability of independent motion. Instead, if it's a brushless 3500 N/m
torque motor that you're after Mr. Giant Robot Crocodile's jaw has what you
need, and guess what: **you have to fight him for it**. (also imagine fighting
a giant robot eagle using massive harpoons and claiming it's super advanced
vision system that can see a pair of lizards mating from 10km away to use in
your home-defense turrets).

Self preservation and aggression are often overlooked characteristics when thinking about
robot ecologies, mainly because the prospect of hostile robots is frightening. But do you know
what's more frightening? Reaching the end of your life and realizing that you didn't experience
a lick of danger or adventure. Leaving violence and self-defensive behaviour out of creatures in
an artificial ecology not only leaves the set of possible interactions incomplete, it also
deprives us of an interesting opportunity: _to align the creation of technology with our
primal instincts_.

Ted Kaczynski talks about
[_surrogate activities_](https://medium.com/chris-messina/surrogate-activities-the-power-process-16203dda87).
Unfortunately most of the process of building technology involves surrogate
activities (which are still infinitely more rewarding than the kind of
surrogate activities most people engage in to acquire technology), and worst of
all a lot of it comes at the expense of real bodily needs like physically
exhausting exercise, sunlight, fresh air, etc.
(think of all the problems a programmer is likely to develop).

A true robot ecology gives us the chance to have technology be a part of nature
instead of industry. To allow technology to autonomously evolve, thereby offloading
design, manufacturing and it's organization to what created _us_. There can't be supply
chain problems when your supply chain is _literally an ecosphere_, and many more people
can probably get good at hunting and farming machines than can work in a semiconductor
fabrication plant&#8212;we've been doing the former for a heck of a long time.

Imagine spear fishing for droids deep in the ocean, and harvesting their
components to build a submarine. Imagine raising robotic camels to build desert
grade cooling systems and devices that can harness water from air. Imagine
fighting a mechanical T-Rex with 15 other guys and a bunch of EMP spears and building
construction mecha's from it's body. Doesn't that sound exciting?
