Ever seen that [PBS Space Time video](https://youtu.be/watch?v=4H55wybU3rI)
about Von Neumann Probes? It's a cool video. The idea of self replicating
robots colonizing the galaxy is cool, but the coolest thing in the video
is a passing reference to a proposal by
[Edward F. Moore](http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/3.1.htm):

> &#8230;desert or ocean-dwelling self-replicators who's only purpose was to build
> copies of themselves, which humans would then harvest for parts&#8230;

I was reminded of this idea reading
[a post](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2021/04/25/a-machine-ecology.html)
by George Hotz.
George talks about machines that can fight entropy, like life. Technology that,
left alone, &ldquo;&#8230;after 5 years it has built a paradise.&rdquo;

Creating a machine ecology not only means that said machines are more robust
than what we have now, it also means that technology can be made a part of nature
instead of industry. This hints at a path to a technological society that is _not_
an industrial one (which may be the positive rebuttal to
[_The Unabomber Manifesto_](https://www.unabombermanifesto.net/)
Hotz searches for). But there is a third interesting possibility that I see
in the machine ecology: _to align technology with primal humanity_.

## Enter the Mekhosphere

Moore's artificial plants, Von Neumann probes and other self-replicators are
certainly good pictures of what technology that can persist with in the absence of
humans should look like, but what about in the _presence_ of humans? Such advanced,
self-sufficient machines could surely leave most if not all of our needs
satisfied. Fully automated farming, city construction, water purification,
security, manufacturing etc. is a hot topic given the world's current state of
_AI hype_, and most people respond by either becoming neo-luddites, accepting
_the singularity_ (or even going full accelerationist like Nick Land)
or suggesting various social welfare systems like UBI to cope with the social
upheaval that is likely to arise from everything being done by machines.

Since the genie is already out of the bottle, there's really no hope for neo-luddites,
and to say I'm sceptical of the good that more welfare would do for the average western
society would be a euphemism. But, I also happen to feel slightly uncomfortable with
the various brands of transhumanism that I'm left to choose between&#8212;this is indeed
quite the pickle.

Luckily, I feel I've stumbled on a fourth path: _The Mekhosphere_, our biosphere's
machine-based sister.

In the previously referenced ideas for robot ecologies, individual machines
are usually collectively directed toward a specific goal, and only interact
in so far as they may cooperate in order to achieve the goal. Said goal is
whatever the humans who created the robots _created_ them to do: harvest
natural materials to build more of themselves, purify water or fertilize soil,
construct factories, space elevators, highways, communications networks etc.
There was a workshop about these sorts of ideas that ran from 2002-2004,
organized by a NASA/Ames Research Center computer scientist,
called
[_Robosphere Self-Sustaining Robotic Ecologies_](http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/3.26.htm).
Despite the similar name, however, a _Robosphere_ is not a _Mekhosphere_.

What distinguishes the two is that machines in the mekhosphere are not designed
as means to an end and as a result do not _necessarily_ cooperate. They are not
mere swarms of robots made to turn mercury into a Dyson Sphere, or build
factories on the Moon (although both are extremely cool). They are not tools,
nor anything else that would make them so closely intertwined with mankind. They are
supposed to be living beings, members of yet another sphere of the ecosystem we
inhabit. Some are peaceful, and would be make good friends, others are hostile
and must be fought off. Both contain within their bodies powerful technology
that can be harnessed. Think _Horizon Zero Dawn_ done on purpose, or as a
friend of mine described it &ldquo;_Cyber-Neolithic_&rdquo; (or Paleolithic
depending on your view of the agricultural revolution).

## There's no need to play God&#8230; _just let go_

Shifting technology away from industry in this way seems to me like a good
alternative. In a way, it can be thought of as _technological secession_. We
give up the right to control technology, and the responsibility associated with
it, handing it over to creation itself.  
The influence machines exert over us is accordingly diminished to sane levels.  
Instead of needing to augment and artificially improve ourselves to keep up
with and continue to direct it's development, we make technology a truly
autonomous feature of our environment, and allow mankind to co-evolve with it in
a relationship more similar to our primordial relationship with other living beings.

As Uncle Ted points out,
living in our current high-tech society predominantly involves
[_surrogate activities_](https://medium.com/chris-messina/surrogate-activities-the-power-process-16203dda87)
of the increasingly mental kind, often at the expense of
our _real needs_. Human beings hunt, forage, farm, trap, play, fight and flee. Our
minds and our hearts are birthed from what we do with our _bodies_, which we
ignore _at our peril_. Adding a _sphere of machines_ to the stage of human
life might be a way to shift emphasis back to the body and real external goals,
to experience and interact with technology in a more _primal_ way.

In a future article I want to go into more detail on what a mekhosphere could look
like, but for now I'll leave you with this.
