It's no secret that, contemporary youth culture is characterized
by impulsive pleasure seeking. Usually when discussing a personal issue with
someone, the sort of response one hears is
&ldquo;I think you should do what makes you happy&rdquo;. One seldom hears
&ldquo;You should do what is right&rdquo; or any other reference to principle.
The _zoomer's_ idea of the meaning of life is to do what you feel like doing.
So long as it doesn't hurt anyone else, _what could possibly be wrong with it_?

There's this weird idea that discipline, adherence to a code of ethics, or
sacrifice are painful and bad. This strikes me as an odd assumption. If someone
decided is was the right thing, _if lot's of people decided it was the right thing_,
if the lord came down upon someone and revealed to them that something was _good_,
why would people begin to assume that it was bad? In my own experience, every time
I've stopped doing something that was wrong but seemingly _easier_ and quicker, I've
realized it was just the opposite. It's like taking of a really heavy backpack and
realizing the flight of stairs you wanted to climb isn't that steep at all.

Here's an analogy I quite like.  
Imagine you're a rock climber. There are many ways to scale a rock face, of varying
degrees of difficulty, elegance, speed etc. But the best way, _the right way_, is
easier than all the rest. It's just hard to find. Of course there's more to bouldering
than just getting to the top of a massive chunk of stone, but I'm trying to make a point.
It may be difficult to find the right path in the midst of so many wrong ones,
but once you find it the task becomes less of a struggle, the burden is significantly
lessened. And I'm convinced this is the case in life
(although admittedly you can poke a few holes in my analogy).

Discipline and adhering to principle takes much of the load off your mind and
your conscience. You could almost think of it as the motion of an inertial body:
when still, the momentum required to set the body in motion is much greater than
if it has gradually sped up over time. There's also the question of changing the
direction of an object already in motion. If you become habituated to operating on
principle and doing what you know to be right, when a difficult moral decision is
required of you there will be enough momentum that any course correction or increase
in speed is easier than it otherwise would be.  
&ldquo;My yoke is easy and my burden is light&rdquo; (Matthew 11:30)

A quick note on sacrifice: the normal connotation of sacrifice is to give up something
you want because you have to. To exchange it for something you want less but is better
for you. When a mother sacrifices her own life to save her child, who's life does she
value more highly? Her's or her child's? Here's a little etymological trick: _artifice_
_sacrifice_. I'm pretty sure I read this in Jung around the beginning of 2020 and totally
forgot about it until recently. To sacrifice something is not to exchange it for something
less valuable, it is to elevate it to the position of highest value. To make it _sacred_.

There's this video by
[imaginaryaxis](https://youtu.be/watch?v=IqYpx22bSwI&t=640s)
about how Batman is insane. In the video it's mentioned that Batman defined his
moral code in a moment of clarity, and that he wouldn't have been able to
under normal conditions. The rest of the time the only thing keeping him from
going nuts is the fact that he has those rules clearly spelled out, meaning
it's merely a question of discipline.

My own principles were tested recently. I had adopted and internalized them in
a similar moment of clarity, and was lucky enough to have a long period of
isolation or _shielding_ from the things that might tempt me to go against
them. The test came from an unlikely place, as I suppose it often does, and
caught me off guard. In isolation we may become prideful or arrogant, thinking
ourselves _holier than thou_. When tested it may be sudden, like a strong wind
throwing you off your feet, or it might be nothing more than an itch in the
back of your mind. One thing to remember is that the easy route is often staying
on your path. Despite feeling driven to do the opposite, consider the complexity
that would be added to your life if you gave in. If however the complexity is
difficult to discern it's good to have a friend who will keep you in check.
Having a public stake, having skin in the game, having people around that know
you and would be disappointed if you succumbed to temptation is the next best
thing after shielding yourself from it. But in the end, it's a matter of sticking
to what you already know to be right.
