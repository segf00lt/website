I quite enjoyed the futuristic theme of the last article,
but I've realized that one statement is not only wrong, but I
never believed it to begin with: &ldquo;the genie is out of the bottle&rdquo;.

For the record, I hadn't thought enough before writing that sentence. I was
also hyped up to get to the point of the article and just thought that would be
a cool thing to put there (sorry Neo-Luddites I didn't really mean it).
Nevertheless, the claim provides an opportunity to write about something I find
important.

# Progress

Like everyone, I too am susceptible to the idea of *progress*. Even people who
identify as postmodernists sometimes fall prey to this meme. George Hotz for
example, _famous postmodernist_, is also a believer in _the singularity_. To
make sure we're all using the same definition, technological singularity
happens when the rate of technological development gets so high that changes in
human civilization become unforeseeable and uncontrollable. Additionally, I
think it's fair to say that most people who believe in the singularity also
believe we're inexorably moving towards it&#8212;&ldquo;the genie is out of the
bottle&rdquo;.

Okay, so why did I bring up postmodernism? Well, a rough definition of it would
be skepticism of the &ldquo;grand modernist narratives&rdquo;. It just so happens that
_progress_, especially of the technological kind, is one such narrative, and
that the &ldquo;inexorable motion towards singularity&rdquo; is a manifestation of said
narrative. The thing with postmodernism is that it's like
post rock&#8212;despite the different song structure and copious amounts of
reverb, there's still a lot of guitar.

It would seem then that postmodern skepticism is not air tight, and _progress_,
or _inevitability_, has managed to slip through.

So with regards to progress/inevitability/singularity
there's 3 points I want to make:

1. That the genie is **not** out of the bottle.
2. The singularity isn't just _evitable_, but it might be way further off
   than anyone thinks.
3. And, seemingly in contradiction with 2, _we're already in the singularity_.

# _Can you make toilet paper?_

I started asking my friends this question last year, and it was usually met
with laughs, but it's a serious question. The answer is of course (unless
you're a ***based*** toilet-paper-factory worker) that you have no freaking
clue what's involved in making toilet paper besides the fact that, at some
point, a tree gets cut down.
Here's a harder one: can you build a microprocessor?
Or even better, _a microprocessor factory_. A few groups of Taiwanese might be
able to, anyone else? China? The EU? What happens when this China VS Taiwan
situation doesn't go how everyone expects it to? Hypothetical &ldquo;We're all
screwed&rdquo; scenario: Shenzhen HiSilicon 1-up's TSMC, and Whinnie the Pooh
promptly carpet bombs Taiwan into submission. _Can you build a microprocessor?_

It's not just that you and most of the world can't, _a microprocessor can't
build a microprocessor_. Genie's may be beholden to their masters but they are
independent beings, and behave as such. This isn't the case with our
machines&#8212;we aren't looking at a genie, we aren't even looking at a puppy
dog.

Conscious of your inability to craft toilet paper, are you anywhere near as certain
that _the singularity is near_? Or that it's somehow inevitable? The toilet paper
question is meant to reveal that out tech depends on industry, and industry along
with most of contemporary civilization is an uncountably large, interdependent
graph&#8212;cloud doesn't even come close, try galactic nebula&#8212;and it's
not only complex, it's **fragile**.

Who's to say that before someone solves the
[Hutter Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutter_Prize),
everyone who knows how to make chips doesn't pass
the knowledge on to the next generation and every processor beyond that point
has more and more strange esoteric faults? It wouldn't be the
[first time](https://www.sigmicro.org/media/oralhistories/colwell.pdf)
(see page 68 of 164, the section on Multiflow).

One more consequence can be derived from the complexity of the civilizational
nebula is that we're already in the singularity. Not only are we _currently_
in a state where &ldquo;changes in human civilization become unforeseeable and
uncontrollable&rdquo;, we're **always** in that state. Patterns can be recognized,
useful predictions and preparations can be made, but the course of history
isn't amenable to logical proof. Many have tried to create such proofs,
_all have failed_. Any apparent correctness is more than likely accidental
and rarely wholistic. No one has a clue what's around the corner, most of those
who say they do are trying to sell you something.

Along with certainty of the future, there is also certainty of the present.
Certainty that we're way better than our ancestors at doing stuff, they were
stupid and we're smart. Or even worse, that we've _solved_ everything. In
reality, the way we do things now may not even be a local maximum, it might
be a local minimum. Simpler, more effective techniques are
[right in front of us](https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/obvious-technical-solutions/),
we just can't see them.

Though this article has a more critical and pessimistic tone, I am optimistic
about the future. You really have to be bitter to not think we live in one of
the coolest most amazing times to be alive and that the road ahead is bright.
But by no means will anything happen because

_History ain't over yet_.
