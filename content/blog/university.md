Around August I returned to university after about a year of being a
semi-dropout. Here are some thoughts I've had since being back.

# Incentives

Whenever people asked me what I was doing during my dropout
period and whether I intended to go back, my answer would usually prompt them
to try and convince me that I'll &ldquo;meet like minded people and make
friends&rdquo; and that I'd be doing something I really enjoyed. For the most
part the latter has been true (digression: is it just me or does everyone
forget which is latter and which is former?)&#8212;The amount of BS work I've
had to put up with in my course is only about 0.1% of my total hours,
everything else (most of which is math) has been quite entertaining, so I can
safely say that it's much more fun than high-school. The former statement,
however, has been mostly false.

From the very beginning of my semester, I noticed that though a small minority
of my classmates were somewhat interested in what we were doing, even this
minority treated everything as they would school work, reacting to difficulty
as something frightening, always asking &ldquo;Is this gonna be on the
exam?&rdquo;, and generally treating the course as a chore. This schoolboy
attitude is indicative of the fact that these people aren't actually there
because they want to be, but instead are there due to some external factor.
I haven't straight up asked anyone yet, but I have a hunch that, when
questioned about it, no one really knows _why_ they're at university.

The cause of this ignorance is manifold: first of all, going to university or
some kind of higher/special education is just what you're &ldquo;supposed to
do&rdquo; after finishing school. This makes the university funnel already
quite large, and quite bad at selecting for people who are interested in what
they're applying for. Secondly, most are too lazy or have too high a time
preference to invest some time into _actually_ exploring the gamut of
possibilities laid before them, before pulling the trigger on any one path (I
used to be in this category). Unfortunately, this behaviour is rewarded by the
schooling environment (and the society at large), making it far more common
than it otherwise would be.

Let's prove that last statement:

- Lemma1: a choice with a certain outcome is preferred to a choice with an
  uncertain outcome.
- Lemma2: something about which one has no knowledge is uncertain.
- Lemma3: the only reasonable way to decide on a something with an uncertain
  outcome is through instinct, courage and the capacity for ownership and
  responsibility over ones decisions.
- Lemma4: the capacities listed in Lemma3 are only developed by getting used to
  making choices with uncertain outcomes.

Suppose Alice is a student finishing high-school. She has already done her
final exams and is in the process of applying to a university (how this
application takes place is irrelevant). However, because most of Alice's time
has been spent in a high-school centered microcosm of reality, she has very
little experience of anything beyond that. As a result she is unsure, at this
&ldquo;pivotal&rdquo; moment in her life, as to what she should do. Should she
continue on the path that every adult she encounters has told her is the right
one and enroll in some prestigious course at a prestigious university? Or
should she take time to wait and explore her options on her own?

Alice (being a _rational_ individual) clearly see's that proceeding on the path
given to her is a sure bet, the outcome is certain, as she has been given
extensive information (which as far as she is concerned is true) about this
path by teachers, family, friends, etc.

On the other hand, exploring on her own is not something she has been exposed
to. It is not necessary for school and as a result occurs only through personal
initiative, that Alice happens not to have. Therefor, having never done or
otherwise heard anything about it, the outcome of this choice is uncertain.
Additionally, since most if not all of her endeavours have involved adult guidance,
directly through a teacher or indirectly through knowledge in textbooks, she
has never had to independently decide on uncertain things, so by Lemma4 and
Lemma3, she is incapable of making such decisions.

Thus, by Lemma1, she will prefer the choice of going to university _now_.  
__Qed__.

This somewhat contrived proof helps to at least build a decent framework for
understanding why the behaviour I've described is so prevalent, but it is
by no means comprehensive.

# Attitude

I did a very small poll where I asked a handful of my friends who are in
university (~5 people) the following question: how many people do you know that
are truly invested in their course? The highest answer I got was 3 (which
included me and the answerer), and the others where all 0 . Why does it have to
be like this? Why is everyone comfortable with being aimless? With doing things
they dislike? Prior to enrolling in Computer Science I personally fell for the
uni scam and enrolled in another course straight out of high-school. But while
I was there and wasn't sure what I actually wanted to do I still tried to _get
into it_. I explored the field on my own time and made an effort to become
interested. When I realized it wasn't for me, I dropped out.

If no one really cares for the path they're on, nobody works on stuff beyond
what they've been told to (or on their own time), and everybody complains about
the work, why do they think university is so important? It's a strange form of
puritanical self-flagellation. Almost as if the whole point of going is to
participate in a huge circle jerk about how _fierce_ you are for putting up
with it. As James Taggart says in _Atlas Shrugged_.
> If she enjoys it, what is there to admire about her doing it?

School has definitely succeeded in numbing people to pointless
stress, and tricking them into thinking that's a sign of virtue.

Will they ever realize this is a dead end? Oh well, _Who is John Galt_?

# Skill

Reading this you may wonder why _I_ am at university. I have a very clear
mission: to acquire skill.  Not to engage in university life or student
politics, and certainly not to start an academic career. Simply to become
exceptional at difficult things I enjoy doing. This has been my explicit
goal since around when I started this blog. I am only at university in so far
as I think it serves this goal. As soon as that changes, I'm out.

As far as I've seen, math education isn't in such a bad
state. But my brush with the course's introduction to programming makes me
skeptical of the other CS focused classes. The drop out rate is among the
highest, up there with physics, which makes me think either the course gets
better and more challenging but the university is bad at selecting candidates,
or it gets worst and the more talented students decide it's a waste of time.
I'd be interested to see the scores of the dropouts.

With regards to the introductory part, most of the first and second semester
could be scrapped and replaced with something between
[nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) and
[fromthetransistor](https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor). Subsequent
semesters could focus on studying various branches of CS more deeply, in a
similar first-principles style. I'm thinking _From Matmul to MNIST_ or
_From the Pixel to Quake_. Devise a simple version of each branch's stack,
and build the whole thing from scratch. But I doubt that an approach like this
could be done when you're busy teaching your freshmen to program in python
(with 3 months dedicated to explaining basic control flow).

Overall it seems that the diagnosis I've heard others give is correct. The
university is dead, for Computer Science anyway, It just doesn't know it yet.
By learning programming on my own I've already outpaced the non-math part of
the curriculum. As soon as I get better at languages like
[coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) and [metamath](https://us.metamath.org/) I'll
likely be able to outpace that part too. If these languages had more online
material and a greater overall web presence, formal math education would become
just like learning to code. A similar approach could be taken with biology,
physics, chemistry, architecture, history, mechanical and electrical
engineering, linguistics&#8212;any field worth it's salt. With the right tools,
the means necessary for intellectual training start to look like
&ldquo;compiler&rdquo; + &ldquo;editor&rdquo; + &ldquo;stackoverflow&rdquo;.
The only barriers to entry are interest and discipline.

Universities as they exist are architecturally constrained. They can only take
so many people before they become overrun by mediocrity, and have no choice but
to be inclusive given the ideology of the faculty members and of those who fund
them. The [suckless](https://suckless.org/philosophy/) guys get it. Catering to
the mainstream is a waste of resources and results in poor quality. Set the bar
high, and only take on those who are serious about learning.

This is the only way for higher education to approach the meritocratic rigor of
the martial arts. The criterion has to be skill, _raw skill_. I don't trust the
judgement of _alt-universities_, and imagine you'd eventually see most of the
same behaviour crop up in them also. To quote

> you don’t do it by defining yourself in opposition to the existing,
you just build something 10x better.

# Friends

I've had trouble sleeping for a while. Busy mind, lot's of unexpressed
thoughts. The other night I went out with a good friend who I hadn't seen in a
while, and managed to free some of the ideas from my own head. I long for this
kind of connection among my classmates.

Whatever replaces university has to foster these kinds of relationships. Once
again, martial arts set a good example. Challenging, upward-bound goals toward
which students can be guided by their teachers. Competition for the approval of
the mentor. Experiences around which real camaraderie and brotherhood can
flourish.

From [Bronze Age Mindset](https://archive.org/details/bronze-age-pervert-bronze-age-mindset-2018).

> Among your instincts you will find the longing for strong friendships,
that the modern evil tries to snuff out. And they have good reason to try this,
because every great thing in the past was done through strong friendships
between two men, or brotherhoods of men, and this includes all great political
things, all acts of political freedom and power. The modern zoo wants you
instead to be a weak and isolated &ldquo;individual.&rdquo; In most Greek
cities there were the aristocratic clubs or fraternities, which were always
places of great plans, great ideas and spiritual ferment. Here were made great
political plans, plans of colonization and exploration of new lands and new
cities, plans of conquest, actions against the designs of tyrants and plebs.
Where is your bulwark today against Babylon, when all this has been made
illegal for you?

general: there is a certain madness, an enthusiasm that exists also in a
community of true scientists or artists, that follows this same pattern. It is
totally forbidden in our time: it’s totally absent in universities, which is
where science has been sequestered.

All you need to do is give in to desire for great things. The true foundation
of the Bronze Age, of the age of great adventures [. . .] You must only embrace
your own instincts with abandon and understand that in common dedication to a
higher cause, a great friend is invaluable because you spur each other on and
keep guard on each other in the mission.
