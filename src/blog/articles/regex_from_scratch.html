		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Around September this year I had the idea to write grep by myself.
		This meant I would also have to implement regular expressions. Little did I
		know, this project would turn out to be the most fun and challenging
		undertaking of the year (up till then).</p>
		<p>Throughout this article I'll reference the resources that helped me during this
		project, and that I hope will help others who decide to give it a try.</p>
		<h2>What are regular expressions <em>really</em>?</h2>
		<p>Regular expressions, as many programmers will know, are a compact way of describing arbitrary
		patterns of text, such as:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><code>a+</code> the letter 'a' one or more times</li>
		<li><code>.*</code> any character any number of times</li>
		<li><code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]+(\.[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)*@[a-zA-Z0-9_].(com|co\.uk|xyz|io|net|)</code> an
		email address</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These expressions range from benign literal strings, to URL's, email addresses,
		C function declarations and more. So how the hell do we implement them?</p>
		<h2>Finite Automata</h2>
		<p>Don't be intimidated by the name of this section. A <em>Finite Automata</em>, or
		<em>State Machine</em>, is a computer with no memory, that can be in 1 or more
		(we'll come back to this) of a finite number of states at a given moment.</p>
		<p>If you've ever seen a flow chart then you kind of understand state machines.
		Each state is connected to other states by a collection of labeled arrows. If
		the input to the machine matches the condition of one of those arrows, the
		machine is moved into the state that the arrow points to, and awaits more
		input. This is done until the machine reaches the <em>end state</em> (or the <em>match state</em>
		as we'll soon call it).</p>
		<p>Before you continue, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhiiia1_hC4">this</a>
		Computerphile video for a great intuitive explanation of state machines from
		Professor Brailsford.</p>
		<p>Alright, now that you've heard the Professor's explanation, let's see how this
		relates to regular expressions.</p>
